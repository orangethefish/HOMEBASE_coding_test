## Task 1: Python Programming
### Problem Statement
    Write a Python program that accomplishes the following:
    1. Reads a CSV file named "data.csv" containing two columns: "Name" and "Age".
    2. Calculates and prints the average age of individuals in the CSV file. 
    3. Gracefully handles potential errors or special cases.
